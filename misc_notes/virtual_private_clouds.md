- VPC, is a secure, individual, private cloud-computing model hosted within a public cloud
- On a VPC, customers can run code, store data, host websites, and do anything else they could do in an ordinary private cloud, but this private cloud is hosted remotely by a public cloud provider
    - This means that VPCs combine the scalability and convenience of public cloud computing with the data isolation of private cloud computing

- VPC networks connect Google Cloud resources to each other and to the internet

- Google Cloud offers two types of VPC networks, determined by their subnet creation mode: auto subnet mode and custom subnet mode
