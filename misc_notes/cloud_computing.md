- Cloud computing is a way of using information technology (IT) that has these 5 equally important traits:
    1. customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service.
    2. customers get access to those resources over the internet, from anywhere they have a connection.
    3. the provider of those resources has a large pool of them, and allocates them to users out of that pool
    4. the resources are elastic â€“ which means they can increase or decrease as needed, so customers can be flexible
    5. customers pay only for what they use, or reserve as they go
