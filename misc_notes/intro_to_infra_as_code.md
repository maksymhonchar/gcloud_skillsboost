- Creating an environment in Google Cloud can mean lots of work, like setting up a compute network and storage resources, and then monitoring their configurations.
- This process can be done manually by writing the commands you need to set up your environment the way you want.

- IaC (Infrastructure as Code) is taking what a required infrastructure needs to look like and defining it as code
    - You capture the code in a template file that is both human readable and machine consumable.
    - IaC tools allow for the creation of entire architectures by using templates.
- Rather than having to use a console or run commands manually to build all parts of the system, the template is used to automatically build the infrastructure.

- Because templates are treated as code, they can be stored in repositories, tracked using version control systems, and shared with other users.
