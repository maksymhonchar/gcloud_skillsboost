- Title:
    - Encoder-Decoder Architecture
- Description: 
    - This course gives you a synopsis of the encoder-decoder architecture, which is a powerful and prevalent machine learning architecture for sequence-to-sequence tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering.
    - You learn about the main components of the encoder-decoder architecture and how to train and serve these models.
    - In the corresponding lab walkthrough, youâ€™ll code in TensorFlow a simple implementation of the encoder-decoder architecture for poetry generation from the beginning.
